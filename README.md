## MC_RN_single.R

### Part 1

(1) Simulations according to Royle & Nichols (2003)

    (i) Poisson 
    
    (ii)Poisson-beta 
    
    (iii) Negative-binomial
    
(2) Adjust data according to RN (2003) and MacKenzie (2003) occupancy models

(3) Assesment of model performance: 
    
    (i) 1-TypeII errors (Power)
    
    (ii) RMSE site-specific occupancies
   
    (iii) Regresion between predicted and trus site specific occupancies

### Part2

(1) Adjust data according to MC extension
    Probability of detection depends on covariates affecting abundances. 

(2) Assessment of model performance (Power, RMSE psis, regression psis).

## RN_RN_JSM.R

(1) Simulations according to RN-JSM model

(2) Adjust data according to RN (2003) and RN-JSM Model

(3) Assessment of model performance
    Comparison between true and fitted covariate effects.
    Evaluation of precision of fitted values.
